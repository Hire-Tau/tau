 * Attention levels. "Watching" used to be one boolean doing two unrelated jobs: it made you an
 * attention recipient for a squad's questions and waits, AND it subscribed you to every work
 * stream's completion notices. This splits those into two KINDS, each carrying the same
 * three-point LEVEL scale, per squad and per work stream:
 *
 *   decisions — anything that needs a human: agent questions, review waits, manual (blocked)
 *               waits, halted agents. These are the "Needs you" items.
 *   progress  — informational activity: a stream's presence in the feed's active-work list and
 *               its completion notice.
 *
 * Levels: `mute` (not even displayed), `show` (displayed, never interrupts), `notify` (displayed,
 * inbox message, and push — push still subject to the user's master toggle and category mutes).
 *
 * Precedence for a user on a stream: the stream's row, else the squad's row, else
 * DEFAULT_ATTENTION. Permissions are resolved first and independently; attention only narrows.
