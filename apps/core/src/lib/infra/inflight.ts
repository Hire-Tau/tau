/**
 * Keyed async concurrency primitives.

 * Two related-but-distinct patterns that were hand-rolled across services:
 *
 * - {@link InflightDeduper}: concurrent callers with the same key SHARE the
 *   one in-flight promise (e.g. "ensure sandbox X" — everyone wants the same
 *   result, doing the work twice is wasteful or harmful).
 * - {@link KeyedSerialQueue}: tasks with the same key run strictly one after
 *   another, each getting its own result (e.g. manifest/store mutations —
 *   read-modify-write cycles that would lose updates if interleaved).
 *
 * Both clean up their map entries once the last task for a key settles, so
 * long-lived processes don't accumulate keys.
