 * "is that process alive?" and gets it wrong whenever the answer is "not quite
 * yet" — notably while a gracefully-shutting-down worker still holds its lock as
 * the next one boots. A candidate skipped that way is never revisited, so the
 * row stays `running` forever: the agent looks busy, does nothing, and holds a
 * concurrency slot. Measured on the dev instance: 9 of 9 `running` executions
 * orphaned this way, oldest ~2 hours.
 *
 * An expired lease with a stale heartbeat needs no inference — the owner has
 * provably stopped renewing, which is a fact in the database rather than a guess
 * about a process. So this pass deliberately skips the liveness proof and runs
 * periodically instead of once.
 *
 * Recovery semantics are unchanged and shared with startup: status back to
 * `queued`, a `[System] Agent recovered…` notice, and the admission handed back,
 * so the agent RESUMES rather than being terminated or reshuffled.
