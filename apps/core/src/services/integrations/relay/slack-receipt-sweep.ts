/**
 * How long a completed Slack dispatch receipt (`integration_event_polling_dispatches`,
 * `providerKey = 'slack'`) is kept after completion before the sweep deletes it.
 *
 * A completed receipt only needs to stay around long enough to answer a
 * redelivery of the same key with "already done": Slack's Events API retries
 * within roughly 30 minutes of the original delivery, and the hosted relay's
 * own redelivery window is bounded by its short pull cadence and lease.
 * 7 days is a wide, cheap safety margin over either without letting a
 * transient dedup row live in the table forever — every actionable channel
 * event the bot sees inserts one (see webhooks.ts / slack-runtime.ts).
 *
 * Scoped to `slack`: GitHub's polling dispatch receipts stay keyed by
 * `activityId`/`eventFact` indefinitely — `authorizeActivitySquad` uses a
 * still-completed row to reattach a *newly* subscribed squad to a past event
 * (see `materializeGitHubDispatch` in services/squad-activity/materialize.ts
 * and its callers in runtime.ts / relay/runtime.ts). Deleting old GitHub rows
 * would silently break that backfill path, so this sweep never touches them.
