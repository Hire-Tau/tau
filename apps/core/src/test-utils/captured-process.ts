/**
 * Spawn a child, capture both streams, and report an outcome that NAMES what
 * happened.
 *
 * Why this exists (docs/history/design/ci-stability-and-flake-eradication.md, Part A):
 * tests that spawn real binaries were written as
 *
 *     const child = Bun.spawn(cmd, { stdout: 'pipe', stderr: 'pipe' })
 *     await child.exited
 *     return child.exitCode
 *
 * which has two defects.
 *
 * 1. **The output is discarded.** A failure reports `Expected: 0, Received:
 *    101` and nothing else. Identifying 101 as a Rust panic required probing
 *    the binary by hand.
 * 2. **A killed child's pipes do not necessarily close.** `sh -c '…; sleep 30'`
 *    leaves `sleep` holding the write end, so a read that only resolves at
 *    end-of-stream hangs past the kill and turns a caller's budget into an
 *    unattributable test timeout. This helper accumulates chunk by chunk and
 *    can abandon the read, so a budget is always reportable.
 *
 * Measured, so the comment does not outlive the fact: Bun does NOT reproduce
 * the classic ~64 KB pipe deadlock. `await child.exited` returns in ~8 ms with
 * 5 MB pending and the full output is still readable afterwards, because Bun
 * buffers the pipe internally. Draining concurrently is still what makes the
 * timeout path work — the accumulated text has to already exist when the read
 * is abandoned — but it is not load-bearing against a deadlock here.
 *
 * It also distinguishes the failure classes that `exitCode` alone collapses.
 * `exitCode` is `null` when a child is killed by a signal, so the common
 * `expect(code).not.toBe(0)` silently accepts a SIGTERM'd child as "the
 * command correctly failed". {@link expectFailedExit} does not.
 *
 * Consumers: `notion/cli.e2e.test.ts`, `notion/core-lifecycle.e2e.test.ts`.
 * Captured output is sanitized through {@link ContentSafety} before it can
 * reach an assertion message, so diagnostics never carry credentials.
